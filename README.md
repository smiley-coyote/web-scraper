# Welcome to my Nintendo News Web Scraper!

This application scrapes Nintendo news articles from https://mynintendonews.com/ and stores them onto a database.

## How does it work you ask?
I used the Cheerio npm package to scrape the articles from the news site
and then wrote with Mongoose to store that data onto a mongodb!
